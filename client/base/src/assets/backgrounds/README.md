Add your Peso Net background assets here.

- Recommended filenames:
  - `peso-net-bg.webp` (animated / modern compressed background)
  - `peso-net-bg.png` (fallback static)

- Place high-quality but optimized images (use webp where possible). Keep sizes reasonable for startup performance (e.g., 1–2MB max).
- If you want animated backgrounds use subtle looping WebP/APNG or CSS particle layers rather than heavy video files.

Reference path in CSS: `/src/assets/backgrounds/peso-net-bg.webp`
